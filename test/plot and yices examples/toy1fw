FW deletion vs NAT public dst address monitoring view
Fd:the condition of FW delete operation
F:the NAT view's selection condition
The FW deletion is irrelevant to the NAT view if and only if (Fd and F) is unsatisfiable. 
Example:

;;FW deletion: delete from rm where (src,dst) in the FW's blacklist
;;(X,Y) is (src,dst) in the FW's blacklist
(define X::int)
(define Y::int)
(assert (or (and (= X 32) (= Y 24)) (and (= X 35) (= Y 34)) (and (= X 35) (= Y 25)) (and (= X 21) (= Y 35)) (and (= X 34) (= Y 20))))

;;NAT view: select src,dst from rm where dst in serviceID
;;(S,T) is (src,dst) in NAT's monitoring view
(define S::int)
(define T::int)
(assert (or (= T 25) (= T 21) (= T 32) (= T 34)))

;;(Fd and F)
(assert (= Y T))
